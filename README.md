SmartPromise is an electronic journal of smart promises developed through Blockchain. 
User of such an environment receives a reward for each of his fulfilled promises. 
The concept of the idea contains the possibility to get a strong motivation to action that user pointed in promise. 

User creates a promise in the journal, sets the deadline for its implementation and at the end 
of this period provides evidence of the fulfillment of his promise. Then user gets a reward for 
keeping the promise. Rewards will be issued by crypto assets and it will consist of users contributions. 
Reward is a contribution multiplied by a factor that depends on difficulty of keeping a promise. 
Thus by contributing user make a deal with himself. The promise fulfilled - the deal is successful. 

We set ourselves the goal of promoting the disclosure of personal motivation. If, one day, a person 
wants to start running in the morning, but he lacks motivation, our project can help him in the implementation of his plan. 

In future, we plan to develop our idea by expanding SmartPromise concept to SmartContract which 
will allow to keep transparency of business deals between participants.
